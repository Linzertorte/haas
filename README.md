# MOC HaaS

This repository contains the Massachusetts Open Cloud's Hardware as
a service tool.

The master branch is intended to only ever contain production-ready
code, but right now most of the codebase is lacking in that regard;
until we've managed to comb through and clean things up to our
satisfaction, the devel branch is where things are happening.
